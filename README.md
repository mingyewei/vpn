Bloggrify is built on top of 
* Nuxt.js 
* Tailwind CSS
* Nuxt-Content 
* and other cool stuff (Hyvor Talk, RssFeedPulse, etc...)

It is a **static** blog generator that uses markdown files to generate blog posts.

If you use this project and it saves you time. [How about supporting it?](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hlassiege)

## Contributing

I created this blog application because I know how **tedious** it is to assemble all the bricks needed to have an SEO-efficient blog, with a clean, accessible design, responsive, with features already integrated (comment system, rss feed, newsletter, sitemap etc...).

All this work, which can take days to do, I'll spare you - **and it's free**.

However, **if you consider that you've really saved time**, **you might consider supporting this work**.
It's optional, but it will be much appreciated.

The first option is to offer me a [virtual coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hlassiege) representing the value of the time you've saved.

But you can also contribute in many other ways:

- by **talking** about this project on social networks, on your blog, with your colleagues. 
- by giving this project **a star** on github
- by contributing to the open source project to improve it (see below)

**10% of the benefits will be donated to the [Unicef foundation](https://www.unicef.org/), an organization that helps children in need all over the world.**

## Contributing to the project

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

Running bloggrify alone without templates won't be really useful.   


```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
